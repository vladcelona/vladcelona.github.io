    "content": `Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.

    When people ask me why I like covering fashion, one of my answers (and I have a couple) is always that clothes are one of the very few universal subjects: Everyone has to think about food, shelter and what they put on their bodies. Even nudists think about what they wear — they just reject the idea of wearing anything.
    
    That’s why, as Harold Koda, the former curator of the Met’s Costume Institute once told me, the decibel levels are measurably higher at a fashion exhibition than at any other show the museum puts on. Everyone feels entitled to have an opinion.
    
    But there are, unquestionably, parts of the clothes conversation that are less accessible than others. Most notably, the haute couture. The what?
    
    Exactly.
    
    Quick crib sheet: haute couture (or let’s just call it “couture” for simplicity’s sake) is a twice-yearly five-day show fiesta in Paris where a select handful of brands produce hand-made-to-order garments that cost approximately  $10,000 to $100,000 a piece. Yes, you read that right.
    
    To qualify as a couture house, which is an official designation like champagne, a brand must maintain an atelier of a certain number of artisans full time and produce a specific number of garments twice a year for a show. There are only a very few that can fulfill the requirements, including Chanel, Dior and Valentino. A lot have dropped out over the years (Balmain, Versace, Saint Laurent), and the governing organization that adjudicates this has relaxed some of its rules to admit younger, less resourced or guest designers, like Iris van Herpen and Guo Pei, who made Rihanna’s Met Gala sunny-side-up egg cape.

    Anyway, there are only a few hundred clients in the world who regularly buy couture, including Middle Eastern royalty and American businesswomen. Guests often sit on gold ballroom chairs. At Chanel, the designer Karl Lagerfeld has a tendency to recreate gardens from around the world, from Versailles to Norway, as his sets.
    
    Sounds like the ultimate let-them-eat-cake event, right? In a world struggling with income inequality, riven by tides of immigration and deep social divisions, where streetwear is on the rise, why cover it at all?
    
    The usual answer from most fashion people, and brands, for that matter, is it’s “the dream”: the ultimate escapist fantasy. But that always struck me as weird, especially now. Don’t know about you, but it was never my dream to wear a giant ball gown and run through the Hall of Mirrors.
    
    And it’s not the “Devil Wears Prada” argument, though that does hold true: In a world where everything goes into the Instagram soup and from there seeps into the cultural digestive system, what might appear on a runway in the Musée Rodin (where Dior holds its shows) in July will affect what H&M does in August.
    
    For me, it’s never been about imagining myself in the clothes, or even being able to buy the clothes, any more than watching great sports is about being able to play soccer like Lionel Messi.
    
    It’s about using this particular craft form as a wormhole into what’s going on in the world. The gowns themselves may not seem that relevant (especially when they reimagine a woman as, say, a lavender bush). But the issues they raise are.

    Like, for example, the fact that to a certain extent any women’s wear collection, at any level, should be a treatise on female identity at that particular moment in time. At least if it’s any good. That’s why Karl Lagerfeld made his Chanel bride wear the pants last January, not the corseted meringue; why at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri paid homage to Leonor Fini, an early 20th century Surrealist (I don’t think anyone would dispute the surreal nature of our current era); why at Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller protected gowns dripping in silver fringe with military greatcoats.
    
    Like the fact that the mostly French gatekeepers of couture, the most rigid of fashion sectors, have increasingly lowered barriers to entry to woo and admit designers from China, Lebanon and Russia. Fashion is acknowledging the value of porous borders, even as its Western European home grows more skittish about them.
    
    Like the fact that this is as good a way as any to talk about the current tension between the handmade and human (and historical) and the technological. It’s the fashion equivalent of reading books versus watching YouTube.
    
    After all, these are all garments created entirely by hand (except in the case of Iris van Herpen, who tends to 3D print a lot of her materials), as part of a long tradition. Last season at Valentino, the designer Pierpaolo Piccioli named every dress after the person who made it, practically fetishizing the artisan in the face of … well, Facebook.`

    "content": `It seems the fashion industry at large is lusting for long-johns and toasty thermals this autumn

    The action of slipping on thermal underwear beneath our clothes is wholly practical, yet deeply reminiscent of childhood tantrums. Few acts oozed teenage rebellion like wearing next to nothing in freezing temperatures. But one of the first styling lessons we learn as we grow older is the value of a good pair of thermals come winter.
    
    
    Advertisement
    Even so, this go-to garment (really the foundation of our Nordic cold-weather wardrobes) has been regaled to hide away beneath finer 'fits. In other words, we've considered it a winterised version of your favourite pyjamas – not meant to be seen.
    
    However, our perspective is quickly shifting, owing to the fashionable upgrade of the humble long john for autumn/winter 2023.
    
    This notion of elevated thermals was cemented by Bottega Veneta this season. Sporting long-sleeved thermal tops, three models made their way down the runway and long johns were given new sartorial status – going from a snow slope exclusive covered by pills, lint and fuzz, to a rarefied staple in our everyday styling arsenal.
    
    
    
    
    The collection's rural romanticism echoed a memory of a Midsommar of the past, when the temperature dropped lower than on Christmas that same year (a true story). Freezing whilst sipping our schnapps for warmth, Bottega Veneta's layered white warmers would have been a readily welcomed wardrobe addition. Yes, they were made for (Italian) winter, but considering our fickle summer weather – especially on Midsommar – and the delicate floral embroideries, it is easy to argue they could, and should, remain in rotation all year round.
    
    Throughout London Fashion Week, we found ourselves drawn to a variety of Scandinavian design details. None more so than the fine-knit base layers at Nensi Dojaka. They resonated – similarly to Bottega Veneta's midsummer long johns – with their wearability and sheer utilitarian usefulness be it in the form of long-sleeved ski tops or body suits.
    
    But when faced with super-cold commutes, we can all agree that thermal leggings are the pinnacle of our winter wardrobes. In fact, we will always recommended Uniqlo's Heattech Long johns as a base layer when combatting chilly morning. But even when caught in the glaringly hot runway spotlights, these knitted tights had a leg up on its competitors – be it slinky, sheer skirts or tailored trousers.
    
    
    Saint Laurent AW23.
    
    
    Ferragamo AW23.
    
    
    Loewe AW23.
    
    Take Saint Laurent, for instance. The French Maison presented leggy looks, pairing graphite grey and black knitted thermals with tone-in-tone tailoring – such as the dove grey blazer above – and surprising material mixes. Be it rendered in silky, broad-shoulder blouses or casually draped checkered wool.
    
    In Milan, Ferragamo's creative director Maximilian Davis had his models donning statement faux furs and superbly cut coats – accentuated by warming body suits and leggings peaking out beneath the hemlines. Even menswear saw the long john reimagined on the runway, with Jonathan Anderson presenting the most classic take on the trend at Loewe – buttons and all.
    
    But few designers have thermals down-pat as well as our locals. The Nordic brands know just how essential these pieces are in a winter wardrobe, after all, resulting in an onslaught of office appropriate iterations emanating from the region. Take the matchy-matchy sets and delicately detailed ski staples shown at Copenhagen, for example, making a case for base layers we won't want to cover up.
    
    
    Remain AW23.
    
    
    Holzweiler AW23.
    
    
    Filippa K AW23.
    
    Consider Holzweiler's crafty crocheted creations; the effervescent effect it would have at your next 'aprés ski', not to mention night out – preferably paired with sultrily lacquered accessories, perhaps even a not-so-subtly flash of lacey lingerie.
    
    At Filippa K, recently appointed creative director Lisa Kessler took a more literal approach with her contrast stitched leggings and ski goggle collaboration inspired by ski jumpers in the '70s. Styled with chunky socks and scrappy sandals, naturally. And yes, you can argue that the body stockings at Remain might not strictly adhere to the traditional definition of long johns, but they provide a warming base layer which –arguably – is the basic function of thermals.
    
    Call us easily influenced, but we're considering foregoing a skin-bearing summer and jump straight into toasty-thermal-autumn. After all, who isn't lusting to layer with long johns – perhaps even putting thermal pieces front and centre – after this fashion month?`

    Timothée Chalamet in a Ludovic de Saint Sernin bathrobe? Bella Hadid in Vivienne Westwood corsetry? The internet’s fashion figureheads imagine a style spectacle that might (but probably won’t) happen
    29April 2022
    TextDaniel Rodgers
    We are bearing witness to the slow and painful demise of the red carpet. That’s not to say there’s any less of them, of course, but that the celebrity circus is losing its cultural sway. The Oscars were boring, even despite The Slap, and so were the Grammys and the VMAs – all of which emerged from the pandemic with about as much fanfare as someone blowing a raspberry. Much of this is to do with the fashion on show. Where famous people once dressed in flanks of raw meat, lolloping stuffed swans around their bare shoulders, they now wear sturdy pantsuits and quinceanera dresses, chosen by big brand sponsors and superstar stylists.

    For fashion fans, however, the Met Gala’s star is still at a glimmer, with Kim Kardashian’s Balenciaga, Rihanna’s Galliano, and Cardi B’s Mugler dangling a carrot above the keyboards of High Fashion Twitter pundits – even if the event’s 2021 edition left much to be desired. “I’ve got major burnout from the disappointing looks year after year,” says HFT’s @DECOUTURIZE. “At the end of the day these celebrities are very boring!” With hindsight, one of the best moments of last year’s Met Gala was when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decided to wear a wedding dress splashed with “TAX THE RICH” in blood-red lettering across her posterior. It told us more about AOC than Billie Eilish’s frothy blush gown or A$AP Rocky, who led photographers up the Met’s staircase, tearing off a patchwork quilt to reveal a… black suit beneath. 
    
    In theory, this year’s Gilded Age theme could buck the banalisation of the red carpet, rooted in an era of rapid economic growth, where technological innovation, bustles, and gay bathhouses were beginning to blossom. “It was when electricity became a thing, a concept which was first looked on as magic,” social media consultant Iolo Edwards says, detailing how he’d like to see Michèle Lamy in one of Rick Owens’ LED headpieces and Timothée Chalamet in a spangled Ludovic de Saint Sernin bathrobe. “But I hate how people have only taken the upper classes into account. The move of the working classes, from agriculture to industry, probably had a bigger impact on fashion, with early photographs of factory workers in their enormous suits reminding me of Yohji Yamamoto’s draped tailoring.” 
    
    There’s no excuse, then, for more nude-illusion gowns – that being said, TikTok thinks Kim Kardashian is going to wear Marilyn Monroe’s “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” dress, with Julia Fox in custom Schiaparelli. Since Joan Rivers’ beloved Fashion Police has been replaced by sprawling social media threads, below, we ask the figureheads of High Fashion Twitter to wager their bets on the upcoming Met Gala, imagining a fashion extravaganza that might (but probably won’t) happen.
    
    BELLA HADID, BY @THEKIMBINO
    “So I’d like to see some archival Christian Lacroix. I recently did a TikTok about him specifically with mention of the Met Gala! Although he’s super problematic, I think John Galliano’s AW97 archive at Christian Dior is brilliant for the theme. But Charles James’ archive is right at the top of my list – like number one – and if I was a celebrity I would pay top notch for a gown by him. Other archial pieces, like McQueen at Givenchy, would be great! Generally speaking, archived looks would always be at the top of my list, but I know how impossible it is to get into them! 
    
    I think whoever goes with Daniel Roseberry has the potential to really stunt, especially with his metal work. Christopher John Rogers has such a strong design language and technique in the way he constructs his clothes that would work really well for the Met, too. Otherwise, Moschino could be a real hit or miss in terms of being really literal in the interpretation. Vivienne Westwood would also be really brilliant – I would love to see Bella or one of the supers wearing her designs. Otherwise, anyone wearing Glenn Martens’ Gaultier is gonna make a real statement.”
    
    NAOMI CAMPBELL, BY @MUGLERIZE
    “What I would like to see is, of course, archival Christian Lacroix. Specifically pieces from either his Prêt-à-Porter collections, or better, Haute Couture, during the mid to late 90s. The reason why I have chosen that specific time period is because the collections were so glamorous, while managing to possess a sense of simplicity that just enhanced and sharpened all that excess. And I know I’m just wishful thinking right now, but I would really love to see Regina King pull something from his archives.
    
    I hope someone flips the theme upside down. The Gilded Age was not just about glamour, jewels, and cinched waists, but it also saw a huge rise in immigration, with most people on the hunt for the American Dream experiencing extreme poverty. So I would like to see someone interpret that part of the era with real senstivity – hopefully in Alexander McQueen’s SS04 collection, Deliverance, which has that same essence and meaning, albeit from a different time in American history.”
    
    KIM KARDASHIAN, BY @IOLOEDWARDS
    “Bustles (butt padding) were essential to the womenswear of the era and I’m sure that we’ll see many of them, but I’m looking forward to see how Thom Browne does it. Though it would be funny to see Kim Kardashian un-reverse her (alleged) brazilian butt lift with one, I think it would be much more on brand for Thom to have a queen like Miss Fame or Symone to wear one with a bare flat chest, queering up the history. Otherwise, should Timothée want a bit of modesty from his towel, once inside he could wear Balenciaga couture by Demna, razor-cut leather bathrobes, and of course an oiled chest could be noted as a nod to Rockefeller’s monopoly on the resource in the press release.”
    
    DOJA CAT, @IDESERVECOUTURE
    “I think it’s a common story at this point that a lot of celebrities are just gonna gloss over the theme. That’s just what happens at the Met – especially with Gilded Glamour because people are just gonna hear the glamour part and run with it, they’re not gonna pay attention to the time period. With that being said, there’s two designers I really want to see. One of them is Vivienne Westwood – she’s one of the rare designers who understands history and uses it in an interesting way, and I can imagine Doja Cat pulling from her collections. The second designer I’d like to see would be John Galliano. I don’t think that’s gonna happen, as we all know about what happened in 2011, but his clothes from that period would fit perfectly with the theme, particularly on Bella or Imaan.”
    
    LIZZO, @FLYREBEL
    “With the red carpet theme being ‘gilded glamour/white tie’ I expect to see a lot of spot-on literal nods to the aesthetic of the gilded age. Bustles, mutton sleeves, elegant, over-the-top gowns, and sharp tuxedos. I’m anxious to see what Christopher John Rogers comes up with – as his purple plaid bustle gown was on display for last year’s Lexicon of Fashion – and I would LOVE to see Tracee Ellis Ross in one of his designs. I’d also love to see Zac Posen take on a gilded age dress. Otherwise, it would be good to see some playful, campy interpretations of the theme – like, I can’t wait to see Daniel Roseberry’s take, ideally on Lizzo – or a nod to gilded age sportswear. I would also love to see Black attendees interpret the theme through the lens of Black style, culture, and climate of the time (the end of Reconstruction, the emergence of the Black elite mirrored by voter suppression, segregation laws, the second Morrill Act, etc).”`
